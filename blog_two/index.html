        <p>Everything started with the result of Intermediate. I secured 70% in Intermediate and decided to go for year
            gap for the preparation of JEE to get into
            <strong>IITs</strong> with a Computer Science Engineering. But, god did'nt want me to go for a gap of whole
            one year. I have given entrance for Engineering and got a private
            admission in private Institution which is only 15 km from my current location or we can say from home. And,
            the thing I like about the college rather than the infrastructure
            they give extra 10% fees concession to the student who have studied in school too. I Forgot to tell that the
            college had there School too where I have complete my basic education
            High School and Intermediate.

            <h2>First Day Of The College</h2>
            <small>July 17 2017</small>
            <p>It was the first I entered the college. Did'nt know more about the college and there corridor. On First
                day,
                I was typical be having like student of HighSchool
                with socially connected to any individual. Roaming here and there, exploring the college area, canteen
                (for
                the name only ), ground and all. Attending lectures like
                a school boy. Being in a college for 8 hours is be like in a jail for the first day with no friends at
                all.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Second Day</strong> Ready for the college, taking scooty and gone from home in the hope that
                today
                someone will be my friend. As I entered a college
                a boy with a cap on his head meet me and with gratitude entered. Finally, made a friend on the second
                day.
                Later On Many More Student were coming day by day in the college,
                and having a interaction with is like I know them for a long period of time. Make too many friends in
                the
                class. Let me tell you the curriculum of the first year of engineering in the next section.</p>

            <h2>First Year</h2>
            <p>First Year Started, with a common subject for all which we have in my sense studied earlier in the
                HighSchool and Intermediate. With a few new subjects i.e <strong>
                    Basic Electrical Engineering, Introduction to Engineering Mechanics, Workshop (Majdoor banane ki
                    kala) etc.</strong> But, Having fun with these subject is next thing.
                I have a question in my mind why these subject is common to all branches in the first year. I got the
                answer in the few day that taking an example when we go in sweett shop
                for buy stuff, we had to taste which sweet is good to buy, similarly, like that having taste of every
                branch of engineering in the first year will decide which branch like most by
                there subjects. Like Choosing <strong> Electrical Engineering </strong> after studying Electrical book ,
                <strong> Mechanical Engineering </strong> by Mechanics ,<strong> Computer Science Engineering </strong>
                with a programming in the first year.
            </p><br>
            <p>Studied One Year and given Exam and Chooed Computer Science Engineering for next three years. Examination
                process has its own story we discuss it later for now good bye and take care.</p>
